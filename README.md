# Winson GR

Senior Backend / AI Systems Engineer

I design, build, and operate production-grade backend systems - distributed services, data pipelines, and AI-enabled platforms that run at real scale.

### What I work on
- Backend architecture & system design
- Event-driven and batch-processing systems
- Data-intensive platforms and AI workflows (RAG, LLM-powered systems)
- Reliability, performance, and cost-aware infrastructure

### Experience highlights
- Built systems processing **20,000+ events/day**
- Owned platforms supporting **10,000+ active subscriptions**
- Designed pipelines handling **300+ GB** of structured and unstructured data
- Took multiple systems from architecture → production → operation

### Tech stack
Python, FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ  
AWS, Docker, Kubernetes  
Distributed systems, async workflows, data pipelines

### How to read this GitHub
