# Winson GR

Backend Engineer - Distributed Systems & AI Data Platforms

I design, build, and operate production-grade backend systems: distributed services, data pipelines, and AI-enabled platforms built for reliability and real-world scale.

## What I work on
- Backend architecture and system design
- Event-driven and batch-processing systems
- Data-intensive platforms and applied AI workflows (RAG, LLM-backed services)
- Reliability, performance, and cost-aware infrastructure

## Experience highlights
- Built systems processing **20,000+ events/day**
- Owned platforms supporting **10,000+ active subscriptions**
- Designed pipelines handling **300+ GB** of structured and unstructured data
- Took multiple systems from **architecture → production → operation**

## Tech stack
Python, FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ  
AWS, Docker, Kubernetes  
Distributed systems, async workflows, data pipelines
