### Winson GR
**Backend Engineer | Python/Go · Postgres · Kafka | Fintech Payment Systems & AI Infrastructure**

🟢 Available for High-Impact Remote Roles (US / EU)

I design, build, and operate production-grade backend systems where correctness, reliability, and cost control matter more than demos. My work focuses on distributed services, data pipelines, and production AI systems in finance-heavy environments.

---

### What I Work On
- **Backend Architecture:** Designing reliability-critical workflows and idempotent systems.
- **Distributed Systems:** Event-driven architectures using Kafka/Redis to decouple services and handle failures safely.
- **AI Infrastructure:** Production RAG pipelines with evaluation, observability, and cost awareness (not prototypes).
- **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines for high-velocity structured and unstructured data with strong consistency guarantees.

---

### Engineering Highlights
- Built backend systems supporting **100,000+ active subscriptions** in revenue-critical environments.
- Optimized data pipelines achieving **~90% query performance improvement** through storage and schema design.
- Designed event-driven systems using **Kafka/Redis** to prevent state corruption and enable safe retries.
- Deployed production AI workflows with failure handling and automated verification.

---

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Node.js  
- **Data & Systems:** PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis  
- **Infrastructure:** FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS  
- **AI Engineering:** RAG pipelines, vector search, evaluation tooling
