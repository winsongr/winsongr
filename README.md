# Winson GR

Backend Engineer - Distributed Systems & AI Data Platforms  
🟢 Available for High-Impact Remote / Contract Roles (US / EU)

I design, build, and operate production-grade backend systems: distributed services, data pipelines, and AI-powered APIs designed for reliability, correctness, and real-world scale.

## What I work on
- Backend architecture and system design
- Event-driven and batch-processing systems
- Data-intensive platforms and applied AI workflows (RAG, LLM-backed services)
- Reliability, performance, and cost-aware infrastructure

## Experience highlights
- Built systems processing **20,000+ events/day**
- Owned platforms supporting **10,000+ active subscriptions**
- Designed ETL pipelines for **high-velocity structured and unstructured data** with strong consistency guarantees
- Took multiple systems from **architecture → production → operation**

## Tech stack

**Backend & Systems**  
Python, FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ  

**Cloud & Infrastructure**  
AWS, Docker, Kubernetes  

**AI & Vector Compute**  
RAG, Embeddings, Pinecone, Qdrant, LangChain
