# Winson GR

Senior Backend / AI Systems Engineer

I design, build, and operate **production-grade backend systems** - distributed services, data pipelines, and AI-enabled platforms that run at real scale.

My work focuses on:
- System design and backend architecture
- Event-driven and batch-processing systems
- Data-intensive platforms and AI workflows
- Reliability, performance, and cost-aware infrastructure

I’ve built and owned systems that:
- Process **20,000+ events per day**
- Support **10,000+ active subscriptions**
- Handle **300+ GB** of structured and unstructured data
- Run reliably under real-world constraints, not demos

This GitHub contains **curated, signal-only repositories** that reflect how I think about architecture, trade-offs, and production systems - not tutorials or experiments.

## Focus Areas
- Backend Engineering (Python, Node.js, FastAPI)
- Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architecture
- Data Pipelines & Batch Processing
- AI Systems (RAG, LLM-powered platforms)
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)

If you're evaluating my profile, start with the pinned repositories - they represent how I design systems meant to survive scale.
